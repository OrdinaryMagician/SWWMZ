### The pickups

Of course some powerups are needed, too.

#### Health Bonus, replaces Health Vial

Health bonuses increase health by 5% up to a 2000% cap.

#### Health Cube, replaces Medbox

Health cubes provide a 100% health boost up to a cap of 1000%.

#### Refresher, replaces Big Keg O' Health

This artifact provides a massive boost of health to 5000%, plus a regeneration
effect that heals 10% every 5 seconds, for up to 60 seconds.

#### Armor Bonus, replaces Health Vial

Cumulative armor items that can increase resistance to all damage by as much
as you can find. Each bonus adds 5% to the total. Above 100%, damage gets
turned into additional health. The upper limit is 500%.

Protection decreases by a 10% of absorbed damage.

#### Blast Suit, replaces Thigh Pads

The blast suit is a nice little light armor which provides a 75% reduction to
elemental damage and 50% to splash damage.

Can handle a total of 5000 damage before breaking.

#### War Armor, replaces Armor

Decent armor, protects very well against all damage. Reduction factors are as
follows:
 * 100% reduction for elemental (fire, ice, electric, etc.)
 * 80% reduction for splash damage from explosives
 * 60% reduction to momentum from any damage
 * 50% reduction to damage from bullets
 * 40% reduction to everything else

The armor can eat up a total of 10000 damage before breaking.

#### Deflector, replaces Shield Belt

This cylinder of pure protection was inherited from UnSX, it was one of the
defense artifacts of the mid-game boss in UnSX 3's planned single player
campaign.

All attacks are deflected, both hitscan and normal projectiles this time.

The deflector runs out after 3 minutes or a total of 5000 damage blocked,
whichever happens first.

#### Ghost Artifact, replaces Invisibility

Actual 100% invisibility guaranteed, a relic from the old UnSX days.

The ghost artifact is capable of turning you absolutely invisible when standing
still, and just slightly more visible when moving, depending on speed.

Firing of course nullifies the effect for a while.

This powerup lasts 60 seconds.

#### Ragekit, replaces Damage Amplifier

The ragekit is a special item that has some... interesting effects.

Quadruples damage dealt, doubles weapon speed, halves damage taken... and has
the side effect of turning you into a screaming beast.

Ragequit happens after 30 seconds.

#### Gravity suppressor, replaces Jump Boots

Continuing with the "replace jump boots with flight" decision in previous mods,
this time you'll be getting a proper easy to control antigravity powerup.

For 60 seconds, you can swim around in the air. Just be careful with height
when the effect is about to run out.
