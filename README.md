### SWWM Z
#### It had to happen sooner or later

--

SWWM Z is a "merged reboot" of my two previous weapon mod projects, SWWM and
the Zanaveth Ultra Suite.

Now that I'm actually a (relatively) sane person, rather than some "lolsorandom
xdxd" edgy kid, expect an actually stable and well-planned weapons mod.

Nah, just kidding. It's more of the same over-the-top gunplay, just like in the
old days.

This project makes use of some few of my never-ever-going-to-be-patented
new technologies for extra fun and comfort in modding.
