### The weapons

The arsenal in SWWMZ is composed entirely of silly overpowered weapons.
Each slot usually has at least two weapons.

SWWMZ has some special weapon mechanics one must familiarize themselves with:
* Durability: Weapons can degrade by taking damage or being used, when on the
  verge of breaking, you'll be alerted. Since this game has no bonfires or
  blacksmiths, healing items double as this mod's "repair powder" (Yes, I am
  aware UT is not Dark Souls).
* Inertia: Because how in the heck could you aim straight while moving, weapons
  have extra force applied to them while you're moving, shooting or getting
  hit.
* Weighting: Currently equiped weapons may affect mobility depending on their
  size (this does not count carried weapons, since those are just in
  hammerspace).
* Recoil: Remember, you are using absurdly overkill firepower here, so you can,
  for example, get kicked back into a bottomless pit after shooting.

#### Unlimited Chainsaw Works, replaces Chainsaw

Ever wanted to throw a chainsaw at someone? Well now you can!

Primary fire simply flings a chainsaw at the enemy, it will come back to you
after bouncing around for a while.

Secondary fire is what gives this weapon its name. Provided you have enough
space around you, summons forth endless swarms of flying chainsaws.

Since the chainsaw rarely is hand-placed around maps, it shares a slot with the
damage amplifier.

It has regenerating ammo.

#### Deep Impact Hammer, replaces Impact Hammer

The signature SWWM melee weapon, an Impact Hammer on steroids.

Primary fire is your usual compressed air push, you can use it to deflect
projectiles, push away enemies, or help yourself jump higher.

Secondary fire is now hold-to-charge. The device compresses air as hard as it
can, then releases a massive airblast at Mach 3 that will tear apart everything
on its way.

Equipped by default on spawned players.

#### Zapper, replaces Impact Hammer

A secondary melee weapon, because one isn't enough.

Primary fire releases short range arc lightning that not only packs a lot of
damage, but causes enemies to go flying upwards a bit from the shock. Released
in water it's lethal to everyone in it, including the owner.

Secondary fire is a long range arc lightning that isn't very precise, but can
cause serious damage on hit and bounces off walls. In water it is of course,
even more lethal.

The Zapper's ammo regenerated over time, although dropped ones can restore it
faster.

Equipped by default on spawned players.

#### Explodium Gun, replaces Enforcer

Primary firearm, another staple of the series, but more volatile than ever.

Primary fire is the usual good ol' explosive shot. A direct hit is pretty much
instant kill, splash damage can also be lethal on unarmored targets.

Secondary fire, a special measure, you just eject the current clip and fling it
at enemies. It explodes for massive damage.

Equipped by default on spawned players.

#### Spreadgun, replaces Enforcer

Secondary firearm, while its original use was as defense against wild rhinos,
it can also be helpful in arena combat. In short, it's a pistol that works
like a shotgun, more or less.

Primary fire shoots (duh). Uses the currently selected fire mode.

Secondary fire switches fire modes between three different levels of spread.

Equipped by default, too.

#### Enhanced Biorifle, replaces Biorifle

A chemical weapon in slot 3? How unexpected! Yes, I didn't even put a lot of
effort on the design, it's just a "different" biorifle.

Primary fire shoots small blobs of "smart slime". Depending on the angle of
impact they might stick perfectly or slide along until the friction stops them.

The "smart" part comes when the blobs "feel" others nearby, they will be
attracted to each other until touch, forming a bigger mass. This mass may grow
dangerously big and explode violently.

The secondary fire is pretty neat. A big fat blob is deployed, which will
happily slide along with you as a sort of sticky sidekick. It will attack any
enemies that get too close.

#### Napalm Gun, replaces Biorifle

A very obvious flamethrower.

Primary fire is, as expected, flames.

Secondary fire spits napalm around, it catches on fire easily, good enough to
make some traps.

#### Legacy Sparkster, replaces Shock Rifle

No dicking around with model numbers here. This is a legacy model that uses
what's best described as "sentient lightning".

Primary fire releases small blobs of energy that have some slight seeking
abilities.

Secondary fire deploys a capsule that releases a massive sphere of pure energy
that tracks down any hostile targets. It's smart enough to be capable of basic
path finding. It has a rather limited lifespan, and can be even shot down.

#### Modern Sparkster, replaces Shock Rifle

Modern models after Dekayed Tech went bankrupt and both NÃ¼tek and Nekratech ate
up all their unfinished work use a different type of ammunition since the
original type of energy has never ever been replicated successfully.

Primary fire shoots a glob of Kynilum plasma, recognizable by its cyan color
and fresh mint smell. The impact damage isn't very great, but it can pass
through multiple targets.

Secondary fire shoots a glob of Nokron plasma, recognizable by a pink color and
a delicious cheese odour. This one explodes on first contact, though, but the
area damage is massive.

#### PROWEL, replaces Enhanced Shock Rifle

A little secret. One of the many "joke weapons" in the UnSX universe. The
PROWEL, along with its sister weapon, the TADEL, not featured here, are two
very strange weapons.

Primary fire, dubbed "Doug's Grate Law Sine Waves" is an insane wave beam type
of attack, that turns enemies into grated cheese sandwiches.

Secondary fire, "Dean's Make-a-fun Gag-a-thon" releases a missile that can
perfectly slide along any surface provided the angle is adequate, and on
explosion, releases what could be described as "fun", in large amounts.

#### Revenge of the Miniclone Machine, replaces Enhanced Shock Rifle

Another secret. I'd say this was a rather original concept on SWWM. The
Miniclone Machine deploys tiny Malcoms that attack your enemies.

Primary fire drops standard miniclones, these are equipped with the default
weapon set and can pick up items.

Secondary fire drops kamikaze miniclones, they carry no weapons and blow up
when getting close enough to a target.

Be advised, these Malcoms don't make rhymes or ask for big macs. They're the
real deal.

#### Gravity Gun, replaces Pulsegun

Signature weapon of the Znv Ultra Suite. In this incarnation, it really
shows that it was inspired by a certain weapon from U4E2k4, not the actual
gravity gun featured in the Nali Weapons series.

Primary fire is the grab beam, you grab enemies with it, shake them around,
smash them against walls, fling them into low orbit, whatever you want.

Secondary fire is a very useful "grapple beam" variation. Rather than grabbing
a target and moving it, the beam holds on to whatever it hits, and then the
user is the one being moved around. Careful usage of this beam allows for
reaching certain areas faster, but if you're not careful, you might crush
yourself against the nearest wall, or send yourself flying (unless that's what
you wanted).

#### Betapulse, replaces Pulsegun

The original polished metal look gives it away, this is obviously the UT Beta
Pulsegun. Only it's not really it. I gave myself some creative freedom to give
it a different "feel" to your typical Pulsegun.

Primary fire is a typical pulse ball attack... but more fun.

Secondary fire releases tentacle rape in the form of pulse beams.

The pulse energy in this weapon is colored yellow because it's more stylish.

#### Splatter, replaces Ripper

Paint walls with the blood of your enemies with another common SWWM weapon.

Primary fire, beam of splatter energy, instant death, instant guts all over
the place.

Secondary fire, ball of splatter energy, splash damage is lethal, even more
guts around.

The Splatter even replicates the Shock Rifle combo this time, try it, you won't
be disappointed.

#### Eviscerator, replaces Ripper

The pleasure of shrapnel spamming. Make hot steaming pain rain upon your
enemies.

Primary fire deploys a curtain of hot lead, it covers a rather wide angle.

Secondary fire unleashes the shitstorm bomb. If you thought primary fire was
spammy, think again.

This weapon makes the Unreal Engine cry, so use with moderation.

#### Spamgun, replaces Minigun

Still needs more dakka.

Primary fire is a moderately spammy high speed stream of bullets.

Secondary fire is absurdly spammier. There is practically no hope for anything
that gets caught under fire.

This weapon also has the potential of frying the engine, and send you flying.

#### Neutralizer, replaces Minigun

The MTx Neutralizer is totally not a line gun ripoff.

Primary fire releases three hovering grenades linked together by lightning
beams. These beams can easily cut through anything.

Secondary fire is a single grenade that releases multiple hovering grenades
with the same property.

#### Chaos Cannon, replaces Flak Cannon

Another classic, refreshed. The weapon that makes good use of trigonometry for
pretty projectile movement.

Primary fire is merely a chaosworm grenade, the worms will fly around wherever
they please until they hit something. The trail left is quite painful to touch.

Secondary fire is a crazy little chaos bomb. As in the original SWWM, it can do
three things: Explode, not explode, or chase enemies.

#### Fire Cannon, replaces Flak Cannon

This time in deeper contact with its inspiration, which you might easily guess,
the Fire Cannon which made its non-public debut in UnSX 1 is back again.

Primary fire releases a highly explosive mortar that blasts away in random
directions, not just opposite to the impact surface anymore.

Secondary fire is an incendiary mortar that spits out fire everywhere.

#### Hellraiser, replaces Rocket Launcher

A satisfying rocket launcher. Back to business again.

Primary fire is the usual BOOM, secondary fire is a grenade, that's all.

#### Quadshot, replaces Rocket Launcher

The author's personal interpretation of an obvious four-barrel shotgun dummied
out from the original Unreal: A fireball launcher. Yes, to this day I still
don't know how I came up with that.

Primary fire is a single flame shot. As in UnSX 1, the flames spit out little
embers during flight, and are perfectly waterproof.

Secondary fire releases four smaller less stable fireballs.

This weapon's easy rocket jumping capabilities have been restored again, they
were completely missing since UnSX 2.5.

#### Mortal Rifle, replaces Sniper Rifle

A replica of the rifle from UnSX 2, with most of its fire modes restored.

Primary fire can be four things:
* Rapid fire: bursts of small explosive bullets
* Radiation beam: the classic, beam that drains health.
* Grenades: tiny little exploding balls.
* Leech darts: little darts that stick to enemies and eat up health. can be
  easily removed by moving around fast enough.

Secondary fire is a zoom.

The reload button (button bextra3, make sure it's bound to something) switches
between fire modes.

#### Silver Bullet, replaces Sniper Rifle

The super powerful .85 caliber sniper rifle responsible for many dislocated
shoulders among its users.

Primary fire shoots, duh. Make sure you aim well and don't move around too much
or you'll easily miss.

Secondary fire is a zoom, easier to manage.

Be careful with how you shoot with this thing, you could get hurt.

#### Messup Machine, replaces Redeemer

Because this damn thing should've been here, not in slot 3.

Primary fire and secondary fire have the same effect: releasing the chasers.

#### Mortal Cannon Artifact, replaces Redeemer

The second artifact returns, this time not as a super shock rifle replacement.

Advances in interpreting the original blueprints have increased the efficiency
of the weapon, completely removing extremely long charge up times.

Primary fire charges a beam of pure destruction. On a perfect hit, it blows up
the target to tiny bits. But if you didn't really aim well, the splash damage
can help too.

Secondary fire charges a beam of pure implosion. A small singularity is born
on the impact spot, it sucks in everything the engine allows for a short time,
then it explodes, returning all the material it has absorbed.

#### Candy Gun, replaces Redeemer

Coming from an old unreleased weapon mini-mod, the candy gun is like an
explodium gun on steroids.

Primary fire releases the explosive candy bullet. Causing a massive blast of
sweetness and death.

Secondary fire throws the weapon away, armed and ready to explode if it hits
anyone or anything.

#### Ynykron Artifact, replaces Redeemer

Because someone will actually want something edgy and gory, let's put in here
the so-called "Fourth Artifact of Nedoshiaan" (remember, the first three
artifacts were: Great Anomaly, Mortal Cannon and Nekrodero). The Ynykron
completely obliterates everything in its way. Not even walls can stop it.

Primary fire releases a normal ray, it will eat away everything, walls just
slow its movement a bit.

Secondary fire releases a seeker ray, these have the added ability of locking
on to nearby players.

#### Super Happy Fun Ball, replaces Redeemer

Do NOT be deceived by the name (though if you know your tropes well, you
surely won't). The SHFB is the ultimate superweapon. An artifact of pure evil,
damnation and pain in multiple body parts.

Primary fire drops the ball. After 10 seconds, something happens. Do not get in
the way. One touch of the ball is instant death, always, even in god mode.

Secondary fire uses the ball as a melee weapon, you just hit people with it,
it's an instant kill for ANYONE no matter what.
